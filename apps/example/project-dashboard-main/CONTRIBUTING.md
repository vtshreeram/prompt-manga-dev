# Contributing

Thanks for checking out this project! This repository is primarily intended as a
personal portfolio / learning resource, but small contributions and feedback are
welcome.

## Ways to contribute

- Improve documentation or clarify code comments.
- Suggest small UX or UI improvements that keep the overall concept intact.
- Fix minor bugs or accessibility issues.

If you want to propose a larger change (new feature, new layout, etc.), please
open an issue first so we can discuss scope and direction.

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch from `main`.
3. Run the app locally and make sure the dashboard still works as expected.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of what you changed and why.

Thanks again for your interest in this project!
